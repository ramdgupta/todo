## **Hour 1-2: React Fundamentals**

### **1. React Components, Props, and State**

- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of a React app. They can be either **class components** or **functional components**.
  
  **Example of a Functional Component**:
  ```javascript
  function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
  }

  ```

  **Class Component**:
  ```javascript
  class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
    }
  }
  ```
Certainly! Here’s an expanded explanation that includes the definition of **`interface`** and its purpose in this context:

1. **`interface GreetingProps`**: Defines a TypeScript interface named `GreetingProps` that specifies the structure of props for the `Greeting` component, requiring a `name` property of type `String`. 

2. **`interface`**: An interface in TypeScript is a way to define the shape of an object, specifying what properties it should have and their types. It serves as a contract for classes and functions to ensure that they adhere to a particular structure. Using interfaces improves type safety and code maintainability by providing clear expectations about how objects should be structured.

3. **`class Greeting`**: Declares a class named `Greeting` that extends from `React.Component`, allowing it to be used as a React component.

4. **`extends`**: A keyword in TypeScript that indicates that the `Greeting` class is inheriting properties and methods from `React.Component`.

5. **`React.Component`**: A base class provided by the React library for creating class components, which includes built-in functionality for managing state and lifecycle methods.

6. **`GreetingProps`**: Refers to the previously defined interface that describes the expected props for the `Greeting` component.

7. **`render()`**: A lifecycle method in a React component that returns the JSX to be rendered to the UI; it is called whenever the component needs to display.

8. **`return`**: A statement used inside the `render` method to specify what should be rendered by the component.

9. **`this.props`**: Refers to the properties passed to the component instance, allowing access to the props defined in the `GreetingProps` interface.

10. **`<Greeting name="Ram"/>`**: A JSX element that creates an instance of the `Greeting` component, passing the string "Ram" as the `name` prop.

11. **`function App()`**: Defines a functional component named `App`, which serves as the main component of the application, rendering the `Greeting` component.

Here’s a one-word summary for each term:

1. **`interface GreetingProps`**: **Structure**
2. **`interface`**: **Definition**
3. **`class Greeting`**: **Component**
4. **`extends`**: **Inheritance**
5. **`React.Component`**: **Base**
6. **`GreetingProps`**: **Props**
7. **`render()`**: **Display**
8. **`return`**: **Output**
9. **`this.props`**: **Access**
10. **`<Greeting name="Ram"/>`**: **Instance**
11. **`function App()`**: **Main**

Certainly! Here are some common interview questions related to React class components, along with brief answers:

1. **What is a React class component?**
   - **Answer**: A React class component is a JavaScript class that extends `React.Component` and must contain a `render()` method, which returns JSX to describe what should be rendered to the UI.

2. **How do you manage state in class components?**
   - **Answer**: State in class components is managed using `this.state` to hold the component's local state, and `this.setState()` to update the state and trigger re-renders.

3. **What are lifecycle methods?**
   - **Answer**: Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow you to hook into different phases of a component’s lifecycle, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

4. **How do you pass props to a class component?**
   - **Answer**: Props are passed to a class component similarly to HTML attributes, and can be accessed via `this.props` within the component.

5. **What is the purpose of `setState`?**
   - **Answer**: `setState` is used to update the component's state, merging the new state with the current state, and triggering a re-render of the component with the updated data.

6. **What is the difference between state and props?**
   - **Answer**: State is managed within a component and can be changed, while props are read-only values passed to a component from its parent and cannot be modified by the component itself.

7. **Can you explain the concept of "lifting state up"?**
   - **Answer**: "Lifting state up" refers to moving state from a child component to a parent component to enable shared access to that state among sibling components.

8. **How do you handle events in class components?**
   - **Answer**: Events are handled using methods defined within the class, which can be bound to `this` in the constructor or using class property syntax to ensure the correct context.

9. **What is `super()` in class components?**
   - **Answer**: `super()` is called in the constructor of a class component to invoke the constructor of the parent class (`React.Component`), allowing access to `this` in the class.

10. **What are default props and how are they used?**
    - **Answer**: Default props are predefined values for props that a component will use if no value is provided by the parent, ensuring the component has necessary data to work with.


These questions and answers should provide a solid foundation for discussing class components in React during an interview.

Functional components do not have a `render` method because:

1. **Simpler Syntax**: They return JSX directly, making the code more concise.
2. **No Instance Creation**: They are regular functions, not class instances.
3. **Hooks**: With Hooks, they can manage state and side effects without needing a `render` method.
4. **Performance**: They can be more performant without the overhead of lifecycle methods.

Yes, you should use PascalCase for functional component names in React. Here are the short points:

1. **Component Identification**: Signals that it’s a React component.
2. **JSX Requirement**: Uppercase names are recognized as components in JSX.
3. **Convention**: Follows established naming conventions in React and JavaScript.
4. **Readability**: Enhances clarity and makes the code easier to understand.

Using PascalCase for function names ensures that React treats them correctly as components.

In essence, functional components streamline component creation by focusing on direct returns without a separate `render` method.


This concise list encapsulates the essence of each term in the context of your React TypeScript code.
### Overall Structure Explanation:
The code defines a React application with a class-based component `Greeting` that accepts a `name` prop through an interface `GreetingProps`. The use of the interface here allows for better type checking and documentation of the component's expected props, ensuring that any instance of `Greeting` will always have a `name` property of type `String`. The main component `App` renders the `Greeting` component, displaying a greeting message with the provided name. This structure helps maintain code quality and clarity, making it easier to manage and understand as the application grows.

Certainly! Here’s a concise, bullet-point summary of why class names in React should start with a capital letter:

Component Identification: Signals to React that it's a custom component.
JSX Syntax Requirement: Lowercase names are treated as HTML elements; uppercase names are recognized as components.
Naming Consistency: Follows the PascalCase convention for class names in JavaScript.
Clarity: Enhances readability and reduces confusion in codebases.
These points capture the essential reasons for using capitalized class names in React.








- **Props**: Props are immutable and used to pass data between components. 
- **State**: State is mutable and managed within the component.

  **Example of Using State in a Functional Component**:
  ```javascript
  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

#### **Practice Problem:**
Write a functional React component that displays a counter and increments it when the button is clicked.

**Solution:**
```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **2. Lifecycle Methods in Class Components vs Hooks in Functional Components**

- **Class Component Lifecycle Methods**:
  - `componentDidMount()`: Called after the component mounts.
  - `componentDidUpdate()`: Called after state or props update.
  - `componentWillUnmount()`: Called right before the component is destroyed.

- **Hooks**: In functional components, lifecycle methods are replaced with **Hooks**.
  - `useEffect()`: Replaces `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component mounted or updated');

    return () => {
      console.log('Component will unmount');
    };
  }, []);  // Empty array ensures this runs only on mount/unmount.
  ```
Here are some short questions an interviewer might ask regarding the provided code and concepts related to class component lifecycle and Hooks in functional components:

1. **What are the three main lifecycle methods of a class component?**
   - **Answer**: `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

2. **What is the purpose of `componentDidMount`?**
   - **Answer**: It runs after the component is mounted, ideal for fetching data or setting up subscriptions.

3. **How does `componentDidUpdate` work?**
   - **Answer**: It is called after the component's state or props have been updated, allowing for side effects based on changes.

4. **When is `componentWillUnmount` used?**
   - **Answer**: It is called right before a component is destroyed, useful for cleanup tasks like removing event listeners.

5. **How do Hooks replace lifecycle methods in functional components?**
   - **Answer**: `useEffect()` replaces `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

6. **What does the empty dependency array `[]` do in `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer**: It ensures that the effect runs only once, similar to `componentDidMount`, and cleans up with `return` similar to `componentWillUnmount`.

7. **What will the console log in the `useEffect` example indicate?**
   - **Answer**: It will log "Component mounted or updated" when the component mounts or updates, and "component will unmount" when it is about to unmount.

8. **Can you explain how cleanup works in `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer**: The cleanup function returned from `useEffect` runs before the component unmounts or before the effect re-runs, allowing for necessary cleanup.


These questions will help assess your understanding of React class component lifecycle methods and how they translate to Hooks in functional components.
Sure! Here’s a list of one-liner questions and answers about mounting and unmounting in React:

### One-Liner Questions and Answers

1. **Q:** What does "mounting" mean in React?  
   **A:** Mounting refers to the process of inserting a component into the DOM.

2. **Q:** Which method is called when a component is mounted?  
   **A:** The `componentDidMount` method is called upon mounting.

3. **Q:** What happens during the unmounting process?  
   **A:** The component is removed from the DOM and cleanup tasks are performed.

4. **Q:** Name a task that is NOT performed during unmounting.  
   **A:** Setting initial state is not a task performed during unmounting.

5. **Q:** What method is used for cleanup before a component unmounts?  
   **A:** The `componentWillUnmount` method is used for cleanup tasks.

6. **Q:** True or False: Mounting is the same as unmounting.  
   **A:** False, mounting is inserting a component, while unmounting is removing it.

7. **Q:** True or False: `componentDidMount` is called multiple times during a component's lifecycle.  
   **A:** False, `componentDidMount` is called only once when the component mounts.

8. **Q:** True or False: A component can respond to interactions after it has been unmounted.  
   **A:** False, an unmounted component cannot respond to interactions.

9. **Q:** Does React's Strict Mode affect the mounting process?  
   **A:** Yes, it can double-invoke methods to help identify side effects.

10. **Q:** Why are cleanup tasks important during unmounting?  
    **A:** Cleanup tasks prevent memory leaks and release resources.

## **Hour 3: Advanced React Topics**

### **3.1 React Memoization (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`)**

- **`React.memo`**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components by memoizing the component.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const MyComponent = React.memo((props) => {
    return <div>{props.data}</div>;
  });
  ```

- **`useCallback`**: Returns a memoized version of the callback function.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const handleClick = React.useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Clicked!');
  }, []);  // Dependencies prevent re-creation.
  ```

- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes a computation-heavy value.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const memoizedValue = React.useMemo(() => {
    return computeHeavyFunction();
  }, [dependency]);
  ```

### **3.2 Context API**

Context API is used to share data between components without passing props manually through every level.

**Example**:
```javascript
const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemedButton />;
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Click me</button>;
}
```

---

## **Hour 4: JavaScript Essentials**

### **4.1 Promises & Async/Await**

- **Promises** are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const fetchData = () => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve('Data received'), 1000);
    });
  };

  fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
  ```

- **Async/Await** is syntactic sugar over promises.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  async function getData() {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
  }
  getData();
  ```

### **4.2 Key JavaScript Concepts**

- **Closure**: A function remembers the variables from its outer scope even when the outer function has returned.
  
  **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function outer() {
    let count = 0;
    return function inner() {
      count++;
      return count;
    };
  }
  const increment = outer();
  console.log(increment());  // 1
  console.log(increment());  // 2
  ```

- **Hoisting**: JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compile phase.

      setTasks([...tasks, { text: input, completed: false }]);
      setInput('');
    }
  };

  const toggleTask = (index) => {
    const newTasks = tasks.map((task, i) => 
      i === index ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
    );
    setTasks(newTasks);
  };

  const deleteTask = (index) => {
    const newTasks = tasks.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
    setTasks(newTasks);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={input} 
        onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} 
        placeholder="Add a task" 
      />
      <button onClick={addTask}>Add</button>

      <ul>
        {tasks.map((task, index) => (
          <li key={index} style={{ textDecoration: task.completed ? 'line-through' : '' }}>
            {task.text}
            <button onClick={() => toggleTask(index)}>Toggle</button>
            <button onClick={() => deleteTask(index)}>Delete</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
